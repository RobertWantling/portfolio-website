          <p class="about-me style-name flex">I seek to aspire to a career that will allow me to channel my creativity and determination to help solve real-world problems through the use of code and hopefully create something beautiful. <br><br> I am always willing to be curious and have a great tendency to ask plenty of questions. I have a great sense of eagerness to preserver through any problem, similar to trying to decipher the beta of a boulder problem, I mirror this feeling and harness it to every facet of life, especially coding. The joy from both summiting a boulder and deducing a coding problem will never cease to amaze me and reminds me of the reason why I love to do both - the challenge and the sense of achievement that comes from overcoming a problem can not be matched. <br><br>

            After taking the leap from the other side of tech, recruitment, I have gained a passionate fondness for coding and have been on the path of learning JavaScript and more recently Python for the past couple of months. The excitement that there\’s no end to what you can learn, accompanied by the gratification you get from coding something, has ignited a new career path and secured a new hobby. I hope that I would bring a new level of creativity and enthusiasm to any team. My natural aptitude for problem solving within the worlds of climbing and coding shows my versatility and allows me to approach challenges with an open mind and a willingness to learn, which I know is crucial in a field that is constantly evolving. 
            
            I am eager to continue learning and growing as a developer, and always open to hearing new opportunities so please get in touch and let’s have a chat! </p>
