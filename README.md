## General Information
  
- A personal website showcasing my recent projects that I have started and where I am continuously in the process of refactoring and adding new features. 
- It is intended to demonstrate my ability as a junior software developer and highlight my strengths as well as show my weaknesses and room for improvement (always open to constructive criticism!)
- I hope throughout the next few months and beyond that I can keep adding and improving this site to further illustrate my coding ability.
